# AIR QUALITY PREDICTION

The dataset for this project was taken from the UCI machine learning repository: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/360/air+quality

### Aim:
This project focuses on predicting air quality using machine learning techniques. This is achieved by building a  model to analyze and forecast air pollution levels based on historical data.

### Project description: 
This is a time series dataset containing 9358 instances of hourly averaged responses from an array of 5 metal oxide chemical sensors embedded in an Air Quality Chemical Multisensor Device. The device was located on the field in a significantly polluted area, at road level,within an Italian city. 
Data were recorded from March 2004 to February 2005 (one year)representing the longest freely available recordings of on field deployed air quality chemical sensor devices responses. 

The description of each feature is available in the attached python notebook.  

### Steps followed: 

* Data Loading
* Data understanding
* Data preprocessing
* Feature engineering
* Model building
* Model evaluation
